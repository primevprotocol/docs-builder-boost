title: Pilot Program Details and Transition to Mainnet
description: Primev will be operational on the Ethereum mainnet. However for the pilot program, the Registry Contract has been deployed on the Sepolia testnet so users can start using the service without paying real ETH. It's important to note that the Sepolia registry is intended for mainnet data and enables searchers to deposit Sepolia ETH in order to access builder hints.
