title: Pilot Phase Details
description: Primev is under a pilot phase as of July '23 where we and early network participants are monitoring the effects of sharing execution data. While mainnet data is being shared during the pilot phase, the Registry Contract is on the Sepolia testnet so early users can test consuming execution data using Sepolia ETH.

When the pilot program concludes, the registry contract will be deployed to the Ethereum mainnet, requiring existing connections to be re-established and mainnet ETH to be deposited to open connections to providers.
