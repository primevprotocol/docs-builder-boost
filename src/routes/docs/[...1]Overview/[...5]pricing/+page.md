title: Primev Pricing
description: Sharing builder hints within the data layer presents a revenue opportunity for Primev-enabled builders, although smaller compared to the settlement layer coming soon that will support use cases such as Pre-confirmations and Order Flow Exchanges.

Builders have the flexibility to define their own pricing terms when registering their address on the contract. By default, the payment is set at 0.1 ETH for a searcher to establish a connection with a builder, with an 80:20 split between the builder and the Primev protocol. In the future, integrating builders will also have a claim on the Primev portion of the funds through protocol treasury tokenization.

Each connection has a predetermined duration of approximately 648,000 slots, equivalent to around 90 days. Both the payment amount and connection duration can be adjusted by enabling builders at any given time.
