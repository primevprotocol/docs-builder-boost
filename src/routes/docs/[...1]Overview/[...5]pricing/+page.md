Primev protocol is free to use and open source.

Providers on the network have the flexibility to define their own pricing for users to consume data when registering their address on the Primev contract. Deposits have an 80:20 split between the provider and the Primev protocol. Primev protocol treasury will be tokenized in the future, and participating providers will gain access to protocol tokens.

We suggest 0.1 ETH as the minimum deposit requirement for a duration of 216000 blocks, which is about 30 days worth. Please [see provider registry](https://docs.primev.xyz/docs/BuilderResources/Registeringoncontract#specify-builder-parameters-and-register) for details on setting registration parameters according to your preferences. The payment amount and connection duration can be adjusted by providers at any given time. If a user deposits more than the minimum amount, the subscription period will be extended in a linear fashion.
