title: Builder Modifications (15 minutes)
description: In this document, we provide both a general overview of the small changes needed to a Geth instance to enable Primev. We will go through a standard fork of the Flashbots builder and walk through the changes that need to be made. We also provide a general overview if your Geth instance has significant changes from the Flashbots builder.

### **Overview**

Builder-boost sits as a sidecar to your execution client. Builder will consistently spin up lightweight go-routines to POST new templates.

# **Quickstart (5 mins)**

If you want to use the off-the-shelf instance of our Builder Reference Implementation, you can follow these two steps:

1. Clone the repository from **[https://github.com/primevprotocol/builder-reference-primev](https://github.com/primevprotocol/builder-reference-primev)**.
2. Build the instance and add the flag **`-builder.remote_primev_endpoint <your-builder-boost-url> --builder.primev_token <your-selected-private-token>`**.

# **Advanced Instructions (optional)**

## **General Overview of Changes Needed**

The idea behind the builder changes is to enable a new local ‚Äúrelay‚Äù to publish blocks to, in a very similar fashion to how blocks are sent to relays like flashbots, blocknative, or agnostic today.

Below is a more detailed perspective of the standard flow in the Flashbots builder. We add a command of **`go SubmitBlockPrimev(&blockData)`** in the SubmitBlock section.

Geth instances have the concept of an IRelay. You simply need to add a **`SubmitBlockPrimev`** to such a relay that is in use and configure any necessary configurations via modifications similar to this commit: **[https://github.com/primevprotocol/builder-reference-primev/commit/9f160e8934fef1aadd21e095c432db41538b93af](https://github.com/primevprotocol/builder-reference-primev/commit/9f160e8934fef1aadd21e095c432db41538b93af)**.

## **Step by Step Walkthrough**

### **Step 1. Registering the Builder Boost environment variables**

#### Step 1a. Primev Endpoint

You can view the entire commit for this section below.

**[Commit: 9f160e8934fef1aadd21e095c432db41538b93af](https://github.com/primevprotocol/builder-reference-primev/commit/9f160e8934fef1aadd21e095c432db41538b93af)**

By the end of this, you can build Geth, and you will see the following output:

```
bashCopy code
**WARN [timestamp] Remote Primev Endpoint is not Set, payloads will not be sent to Primev Network**

```

If you set the correct environment variable **`BUILDER_REMOTE_PRIMEV_ENDPOINT`** or pass in the flag **`builder.remote_primev_endpoint`** while running Geth, you'll see the following successful message:

```
bashCopy code
**INFO [timestamp] Remote Primev Endpoint is Set, payloads will be sent to Primev Network endpoint=<Your builder boost URL>**

```

#### Step 1b. Primev auth Token

The **primev auth token** is used to authorize and authenticate the builder instance. This is to ensure only your builders can post payloads to Boost.

The following link showcases the necessary modifications to set up the Primev Auth Token:

**[Commit: d9b8addd1fdeea8c841a43ff7653e7c9345e7e0d](https://github.com/primevprotocol/primev-builder/commit/d9b8addd1fdeea8c841a43ff7653e7c9345e7e0d)**

We will describe below in Step 3 how to submit the request. Ensure you make the modification to add the **`X-Builder-Token: <primev-token>`** header to the POST request that is made to Boost.

### **Step 2. Updating the Relay Interface to Support Block Submission to Primev/Builder Boost**

In this commit, we simply add all the required function details to support updating the Relay interface to publish to Builder Boost.

**[Commit: 6d8ae9aae17a1b966ac0f682ba9843bd8746dc4f](https://github.com/primevprotocol/builder-reference-primev/commit/6d8ae9aae17a1b966ac0f682ba9843bd8746dc4f)**

#### **Step 2a. Update interface needs for Unit Tests**

Follow the commit to add a stub for the **`testRelay`** to ensure it adheres to the new interface.

**[Commit: 122e82ee6072ff2cda94ed8e75fdd861befccd19](https://github.com/primevprotocol/builder-reference-primev/commit/122e82ee6072ff2cda94ed8e75fdd861befccd19)**

### **Step 3. Start Submitting Blocks to Builder Boost**

Finally we submit the block details via a go-routine to ensure we don't block for the response:

**[Commit: 04d81efdf499ada3cee303316665edf0d5945a27](https://github.com/primevprotocol/builder-reference-primev/commit/04d81efdf499ada3cee303316665edf0d5945a27)**

Voila, your Block builder is now a bleeding edge builder that can share execution data! Not some off the shelf Block builder üòâ
